# Quicksort and-Random Quicksort

This repositry contains an implementation of the **Quicksort** and **Randomized Quicksort** sorting algorithms.
 
## Additional information

Seeing as these algorithms can be implemented using both *recursion* and *iteration*, both of these solutions can be found in this repositry.  

***Randomized Quicksort*** is used to boost the performance of ***Quicksort*** by choosing a random element as pivot.

### Time and Space Complexity

**Time complexity** - ***Worst Case*** O(n^2)  
**Time complexity** - ***Best Case*** O(nlogn)  
**Space complexity** - O(n) (used to store the array)
